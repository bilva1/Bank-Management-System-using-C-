# Bank-Management-System-using-C++
Implementation of "Bank Management System" using C++
In this project, I have created a class "bank" in which I have defined void functions such as: open_account(),deposit_money(),withdraw_money(),display_account().
1.open_account()-collects the basic user details from the console and creates a bank account.
2.deposit_money()-finds out the amount of cash the user wants to deposit in the bank and fulfills the task successfully.Thereafter the balance gets incremented.
3.withdraw_money()-finds out the exact amount of cash the user wants to withdraw from his bank account.Thereafter the balance gets decremented.
4.display_account()-displays the user's account details to him/her.
do-while loop is used for efficiency.
